AI/ML Engineer | Building Intelligent Systems That Actually Work  

I focus on creating practical, high-impact AI solutions — from LLM-powered applications to medical imaging pipelines and computer vision systems. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, engineering clean solutions, and continuously pushing my technical boundaries.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
🎯 Focus: Developing reliable, end-to-end AI systems using LLMs, RAG, and Computer Vision.  
🌱 Currently Learning: Advanced LLM agents, multi-modal models, scalable cloud deployment.  
🧠 Philosophy: Simplicity wins. If the solution is messy, it’s wrong.  
🚀 Mission: Build AI tools that solve real problems, not theoretical ones.
